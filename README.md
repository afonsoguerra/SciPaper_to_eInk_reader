# SciPaper_to_eInk_reader
Custom options for using k2pdfopt to convert papers and pdf books to kindle compatible PDFs


- Based on and depends on k2pdfopt that can be obtained elsewhere. 
- My preferred custom options for reading on a 1st gen Kindle Paperwhite.
- Not perfect and needs manual tweaks depending on journal.
