Custom options for using k2pdfopt to convert papers and pdf books to kindle compatible PDFs


- Based on and depends on k2pdfopt that can be obtained elsewhere. 
- My preferred custom options for reading on a 1st gen Kindle Paperwhite.
- Not perfect and needs manual tweaks depending on journal.

Update 2024: I have actually stopped using this myself because my kindle literally broke by itself one day. Shattered glass. I replaced it with a Kobo which is a much much nicer software base and doesn't need that much work. Coupled with koreader http://koreader.rocks , which incidentally also bundles k2pdfopt, it brings about a streamlined experience that I highly recommend.
